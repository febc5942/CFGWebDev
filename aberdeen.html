            <h3>Location and History</h3>
            <p>Aberdeen is a port town located in North East Scotland. It is the third most populous city in Scotland and in 2020 had an official population of 198,590. The city is 93 miles northeast of Edinburgh and 398 miles north of London. It is the northernmost major city in the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Aberdeen area has been inhabited for at least 8,000 years. The city began as two seperate burghs: Old Aberdeen at the mouth of the River Don; and New Aberdeen a fishing and trading settlement, where the Denburn waterway entered the river Dee estuary.</p>
            <p>During the Wars of Scottish Independence, Aberdeen was under English rule, so Robert the Bruce laid siege to Aberdeen Castle before destroying it in 1308, followed by executing the English garrison. The city was burned by Edward III of England in 1336, but was rebuilt and extended. The city was strongly fortified to prevent attacks by neighbouring lords, but the gates were removed by 1770.</p>
            <p>During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms of 1644 to 1647 the city was plundered by both sides. In 1644, it was taken and ransacked by Royalist troops after the Battle of Aberdeen and two years later it was stormed by a Royalist force under the command of the Marquis of Huntly. In 1647 an outbreak of bubonic plague killed a quarter of the population. In the 18th century, a new Town Hall was built and the first social services appeared with the Infirmary at Woolmanhill in 1742 and the Lunatic Asylum in 1779. The council began major road improvements at the end of the 18th century with the main thoroughfares of George Street, King Street and Union Street all completed at the beginning of the 19th century.</p>
            <p>In 1969 North Sea oil was discovered and Aberdeen became known as the offshore oil capital of Europe</p>
